# EV35 Team Trio – Road Accident Severity Analysis

## Overview
This project was developed as part of an **ML hackathon (EV35)** and focuses on analyzing road accident data to derive insights and build predictive understanding around accident severity. The solution combines **machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization** to support data-driven decision-making for road safety.

The repository is structured to reflect **professional ML project practices**, with clear separation of code, data references, documentation, and dashboards.

---

## Project Objectives
- Analyze large-scale road accident datasets  
- Identify key factors influencing accident severity  
- Build and evaluate machine learning models  
- Present insights through an interactive **Power BI dashboard**

## Dataset & Model Files
Due to **GitHub file size limitations**, the complete dataset and trained machine learning model files are **not stored directly in this repository**.

- **All Resources:** [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lEyGv9ESokCe87ad8p6aGBukgXiXSfeg) 
- **Dataset (CSV files):** [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lEyGv9ESokCe87ad8p6aGBukgXiXSfeg)  
- **Trained Models (.pkl):** [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S-mgY4dW-BhR0P6U-4A_AnWoKPdCtbAT/view)  

Download links are intentionally documented externally to keep the repository lightweight and professional.

After downloading:
- Place dataset files as referenced in `data/source_data.txt`
- Load models directly within the notebook if required

## Code
- `code/source_code.ipynb`  
  Contains the complete end-to-end workflow:
  - Data loading  
  - Data cleaning & preprocessing  
  - Exploratory data analysis  
  - Feature engineering  
  - Model training & evaluation  

The notebook is organized sequentially to reflect a standard ML pipeline.
